This is the story of thousands of expired #476visa holders. 

@ScottMorrisonMP @AlexHawkeMP
Why only neglect #476visa from restoring visas? Same as other visas #476visa  also deserves it.

Even we have fully working right, which will reduce skill shortage. Check ->

It’s terrible the that Australian Government had allowed this to happen. #476visa holders are being treated in a very inhumane way. 
@AlexHawkeMP
you have the power to end this misery once and for all #auspol

I was one of thousands engineers who has expired #476visa due to Australian border closure, without a fault of my own. 

With close to 5 years of experience, I could easily full fill the skill shortage in Australia if

#476visa holders are the solution to the ongoing engineers’ shortage that’s identified by 
@EngAustralia
. Our visas that expired due to border closures must be extended immediately #auspol 
@AlexHawkeMP
 it’s well within your power to do that and end this misery

We are seeking Justice from 
@AlexHawkeMP. What is our fault, when 23 months were Australian borders closed? 
We are 100's of engineers having expired #476visa are stuck overseas. We demand an Automatic visa extension as you did for the 485 visas, why not for 476?

Skilled migrants with #476visa have been waiting for over 2 years for re-entry to Australia. Delaying their arrivals costs millions in extra infrastructure costs.
While LNP & ALP remain silent over this injustice only 
@Greens
 have called for their return.

Every industry is crippled by staff shortages yet highly skilled graduate 476 visa holders are waiting for replacement visa. We have been waiting for 2 years already. Don’t understand why we are being treated like this

It’s important when an institution like 
@EngAustralia
 acknowledges the importance of #476visa holders to the engineering sector in Australia. 
@AlexHawkeMP
 & The Department of Home Affairs must act quickly to restore expired visa that were affected by the pandemic #auspol

#476visa is a visa given to engineers only. According to 
@EngAustralia
, #476visa holders have in the past contributed massively to the engineering sector in Australia, delivering projects across the nation.  #auspol

@AlexHawkeMP
  
I applied for the visa and YOU gave me the grant.
But due to covid ,YOU closed the borders and now YOU have opened the border.
Now YOU r in the position sir to give us a replacement visa.
We have lost our lifetime opportunity.

Dear respected 
@karenandrewsmp
 as HOD of Home Affairs, you’d be interested to know that 
@EngAustralia
 recognizes the importance of #476visa. Logically, visas that expired due to border closures should be extended immediately, please advise 
@AlexHawkeMP
 on this matter #auspol

Thousands of skilled engineering graduates holding expired Visa 476 could not enter. We never stepped foot in Australia and saw our visas getting expired helplessly.

The government is processing new & pending #476visa applications, which indicates that Australia is in need of new skilled migrants, in the same breath, they refuse to extend visas of #476visa holders who had their visas expire due to border closures #auspol #makeitmakesense

Our qualifications are vital to Australia’s economy. 
@EngAustralia
 recognizes the importance of #476visa we lost our visas due to border closures, kindly, extend our visas #auspol

✅ The Washington Accord is an agreement of mutual recognition between signatories
✅ New holders & tourists can enter AU
✅ Other expired visas get auto extension
✅ We are experienced engineers (visa application/processing & border closure took time)
RESTORE #476VISA! #auspol

Enough exclusion!

Mining, Metallurgical, Civil, Survey, and other ENGINEERS are vital to Australia's most economically important industries such as mining, construction, and manufacturing.

Please include #476visa on the list of expired visas to be restored! #auspol

Engineers can help minimize the risk of project cost escalation and delivery delays. This is beneficial to AU's economy and community.

Other expired visas got auto extensions. 

PLEASE ALSO RESTORE #476VISA!
@AlexHawkeMP @karenandrewsmp @KKeneally

There's a "strong global demand" for engineers. "Countries around the world leverage infrastructure as part of post-COVID stimulus strategies."

Tourists can enter AU. Other expired visas got auto extensions.

PLEASE RESTORE #476VISA!

Australia is one of the most economical country on this planet.
The role of engineer is vital in growing economy especially in these tough situations. Due to border restrictions the skill migrants #476visa expired. Indeed it is a matter of time to restore our visa #auspol
---
Why "ONLY" us? Were we, #476visa holders, responsible for Covid? Did we not suffer like everyone else?
#Restore476 #auspoll #auspol

it is really unfair not to extend this visa ONLY while extending other visas expired due to border closure 
---
Engineers Australia @EngAustralia has acknowledged the importance of migrant engineers to Australia.

@ScottMorrisonMP  You replaced other expired visa types. Why ONLY discard #476
Please also restore #476visa!
#auspol #justicefor476

@AlexHawkeMP
 you amended migration policies for 485 visas. They can get extensions & apply for a 2nd time (originally it’s given once in a lifetime), #476visa was affected the same way, extend our visas too #auspol 

Please don't have double standards.

I have a strong believe that : "Engineers make things better"
On the behalf of all Skilled engineers who lost their right to work, making a plea to Australian Government to Restore #476visa as soon as possible.
@ScottMorrisonMP @Greens @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus
---
It’s unbelievable that the Government would ignore engineers who would help the engineering sector. @EngAustralia recognizes our importance but the Government doesn’t. Extend our visas now #476visa #auspol
---
Another ironic thing is that there is a critical skill shortage of engineers in Australia. We have here an available pool of skilled engineers. They gave auto extention to other expired visa types & allowed new #476visa holders & tourists in. Why are we excluded? #AusPol
---
The stress and frustration @AlexHawkeMP and his department have caused on #476visa holders can’t be put into words. You’ve extended all visas and left us behind, as if it was our fault the borders were shut. Skilled migrants deserve more respect #auspol
--- 
There is a staff shortage yet expired #476visa holders haven't been given replacement visas. We are highly skilled Engineers with full working rights who can help reduce  this staff shortage 
@AlexHawkeMP @SBSNews @NickMcKim @EngAustralia @RestoreVisa476
---
It’s absurd that @AlexHawkeMP & his department pick and choose when it comes to extending visas that were affected by Covid19. #476visa holders were excluded even though we’re going to be contributing to the economy and the engineering sector in particular #auspol

#auspol #AusPol2022 
@AlexHawkeMP @ScottMorrisonMP

I don't know why the gov can't see how vital 476 visa holders to the Economy.
Don't take our opinion, please see what your official body for the engineers saying. Take it serious guys, this means lot to us.

Engineers Australia is also acknowledged the fact that #476visa holders can significantly reduce skill shortage in quick succession. 

If you see this message #RT and help us to deliver it to larger audience.

Facts:
1. Since #476visa holders have fully working right, can contribute to economy straight away
2. Have 4+ years of experience right now (visa grant time + border closure period )
3. We have experience working with world recognised engineering organisations

Some of us waited for months or years to get #476visa and we lost it due to border closures, we’ll be filling skill shortages in the engineering sector. We demand to have our visas back. It’s not our FAULT #auspol

Pls reinstate my expired skilled graduate visa subclass 476.
I got affected by border closure and it's not my FAULT.
Show some courtesy towards us as well just like you showed for subclass 485 visa holders by providing them replacement visa.
