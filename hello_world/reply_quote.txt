Why only neglect #476visa from restoring visas? Same as other visas #476visa  also deserves it.

Even we have fully working right, which will reduce skill shortage. Check ->

I was one of thousands engineers who has expired #476visa due to Australian border closure, without a fault of my own.

#476visa holders are the solution to the ongoing engineers’ shortage that’s identified by 
@EngAustralia
. Our visas that expired due to border closures must be extended immediately #auspol

We are seeking Justice from 
@AlexHawkeMP. What is our fault, when 23 months were Australian borders closed? 
We demand an Automatic visa extension as you did for the 485 visas, why not for 476?

Skilled migrants with #476visa have been waiting for over 2 years for re-entry to Australia. Delaying their arrivals costs millions in extra infrastructure costs.

Every industry is crippled by staff shortages yet highly skilled graduate 476 visa holders are waiting for replacement visa. We have been waiting for 2 years. Don’t understand why we are being treated like this

#476visa holders are in a race against time to have the current government address our issue before the election. We can’t keep waiting. It’s already been 23 months #auspol Extend our visas 
@AlexHawkeMP

Its time to give attention to the serious concern of all those #476Visa applicants who are suffering due to border closer and the unfair and unjust response of DHA.

It’s important when an institution like @EngAustralia acknowledges the importance of #476visa holders to the engineering sector in Australia. 
@AlexHawkeMP & Home Affairs must act quickly to restore expired visas #auspol
---  
Dear respected @karenandrewsmp as HOD of Home Affairs, you’d be interested to know that @EngAustralia recognizes the importance of #476visa. Logically, visas that expired due to border closures should be extended immediately #auspol

Thousands of skilled engineering graduates holding expired Visa 476 could not enter. We never stepped foot in Australia and saw our visas getting expired helplessly.

Our qualifications are vital to Australia’s economy.

 recognizes the importance of #476visa we lost our visas due to border closures, kindly, extend our visas #auspol

✅ The Washington Accord is an agreement of mutual recognition between signatories
✅ Other expired visas get auto extension
✅ We are experienced engineers
RESTORE #476VISA! #auspol

Enough exclusion! 
@AlexHawkeMP
 we deserve fair treatment. We’re skilled migrants who have waited for years #476visa border closures were not our fault

Mining, Metallurgical, Civil, Survey, and other ENGINEERS are vital to Australia's most economically important industries such as mining, construction, and manufacturing.

Please include #476visa on the list of expired visas to be restored! #auspol
---
Engineers can help minimize the risk of project cost escalation and delivery delays. This is beneficial to AU's economy and community.

Other expired visas got auto extensions. 

PLEASE RESTORE #476VISA! #auspol

Why "ONLY" us? Were we, #476visa holders, responsible for Covid? Did we not suffer like everyone else?
#Restore476 #auspoll #auspol

it is really unfair not to extend this visa ONLY.
---
@EngAustralia has acknowledged the importance of migrant engineers to Australia.

@ScottMorrisonMP  You replaced other expired visa types. Why ONLY discard #476
Please restore #476visa!
#auspol
---
It’s unbelievable that the Government would ignore engineers who would help the engineering sector. @EngAustralia recognizes our importance but the @ausgov doesn’t. Extend our visas now #476visa #auspol
---
Another ironic thing is that there is a critical skill shortage of engineers in Australia. We have here an available pool of skilled engineers. They gave auto extention to other expired visa types. Why are we excluded? #AusPol
---
The stress and frustration @AlexHawkeMP and his department have caused on #476visa holders can’t be put into words. You’ve extended all visas and left us behind. Skilled migrants deserve more respect #auspol
--- 
There is a staff shortage yet expired #476visa holders haven't been given replacement visas. We are highly skilled Engineers with full working rights who can help reduce  this staff shortage 
@AlexHawkeMP

Engineers Australia is also acknowledged the fact that #476visa holders can significantly reduce skill shortage in quick succession.

Facts:
1. Since #476visa holders have fully working right, can contribute to economy straight away
2. Have 4+ years of experience
3. We have experience working with world recognised organisations

Professional body of "Engineers Australia" is also acknowledging the fact that importance of Engineers to rebuild Australia after pandemic.

Some of us waited for months or years to get #476visa and we lost it due to border closures, we’ll be filling skill shortages in the engineering sector. We demand to have our visas back. It’s not our FAULT #auspol 
@AlexHawkeMP

Pls reinstate my expired skilled graduate visa subclass 476.
I got affected by border closure and it's not my FAULT.
Show some courtesy towards us as well just like you showed for other visas.
@AlexHawkeMP @ScottMorrisonMP

We are desperately waiting for the automatic extension of expired 476 visas.
Why injustice with us?
Why we are being ignored? Why ONLY 476 VISA?

Why are we, expired Subclass #476visa holders, being ignored? If 
@AlexHawkeMP
 you can replace Visa for SC 485 then why wouldn't you treat us same? We need justice.
